# Schedule_optimization

Overview

This project aims to find the optimal schedule for new TV programs based on historical viewership patterns and program metadata. The goal is to maximize Total Ratings Points (TRP) while respecting business rules and scheduling constraints.

The project demonstrates how deterministic optimization (CP-SAT) can replace manual or heuristic scheduling, ensuring feasible, fair, and high-performing weekly TV grids.

Features
	•	Handles weekday (Mon–Fri) and weekend (Sat–Sun) programs with different durations.
	•	Ensures genre spacing: consecutive shows do not belong to the same genre.
	•	Uses TRP-based peak and forbidden slots to maximize viewership.
	•	Incorporates metadata generated by LLMs (subgenre, tone, violence, themes, age group) for better scheduling decisions.
	•	Generates a readable weekly schedule, color-coded by genre.
	•	Automatically optimizes program placement using Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver.

Input Data
	•	viewership_tv_aug.csv: Historical 1 month data for different programs.
	•	Programs_to_place.txt: List of new programs to schedule.
	•	grid.xlsx: Empty weekly TV grid (Monday 6:00 → Sunday 6:00, 30-min slots).

Output
	•	grid.xlsx: Optimized schedule filled with new programs.
